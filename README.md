# DEEJ Advanced Note Taker

## Will have Vim Motions
    How to use:
        1) if you are in NORMAL mode, then the follow commands work:
            j = <- {direction}
            k = -> {direction}
            h = ^(UP) {direction}
            l = | (DOWN) {direction}
            w = {next word to the RIGHT}
            b = {next word to the LEFT}
            p = PASTE {IMPORTANT: you have to YANK first}
            i = INSERT mode
    
        2) if you are in VISUAL mode:
            {IMPORTANT: you will still be able to use NORMAL MODE motions}
            y = YANK
            i = INSERT mode
            ESC = NORMAL mode
            

        3) if you are in INSERT mode:
            {IMPORTANT: you can type anthing but WILL NOT have NORMAL MODE movements}
            ESC = NORMAL mode
